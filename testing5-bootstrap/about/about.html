                Hi! I'm Hannah, which you probably already guessed by the name of my website. I'm based in Germany - I immigrated here from the US with my husband and cat, Donut, in 2022. I love living near the Alps and spend a lot of my time hiking when the weather is warm. Having lived most of my life without a first-hand experience of winter (Texas and California), I spend most of the cold months indoors here.<br><br>
                
                I'm a chimeric mash-up of a hobbyist artist and a professional scientist. My artwork primarily comprises handprinted linoleum block prints, bespoke stained glass, and gel pen drawings inspired by all of favorite things - science, sci-fi, animals, and nature. <br><br>

                I made this website to share what I make, and I hope you enjoy looking around!<br><br>

                I also want to be clear that AI is not used in any of my artwork, and I do not permit AI training to use any of my images!
